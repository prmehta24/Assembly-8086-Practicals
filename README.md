# Assembly-8086-Practicals
Assembly(8086) Practicals at CE701 Interfacing with Microprocessors(IWM) Labs at Nirma University 2019-20
* All codes created by Parimal Mehta
* I have coded programs to:
  1. To perform operations like addition, subtraction, or, and, not
  2. Perform binary arithmetic operations on two 32 bit numbers.
  3. Find maximum value in array.
  4. To perform insertion sort on an array.
  5. 
      * a)  String related interrupt handling: input, display string.
      * b)  Find the number of 1â€™s of given 8 bit number determine its parity and display the result.
 * I tested these programs using [emu8086](https://download.cnet.com/Emu8086-Microprocessor-Emulator/3000-2069_4-10392690.html) and [tasm](https://mccshreyas.wordpress.com/2017/03/27/how-to-install-and-configure-tasm-on-windows-7810/).
